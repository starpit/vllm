//! [`ConcurrencyModel`] — what overlaps on the target hardware.
//!
//! Consulted by the post-scheduler cost aggregator (see
//! [`crate::cost`]) when two implementations land in the same wave.
//! Without it the cost model would happily produce a multi-stream
//! schedule that doesn't actually run faster (e.g. two compute-bound
//! GEMMs on different streams that both hit the saturated tensor
//! core).
//!
//! Ported verbatim from `ferrite-solver/src/lowering/concurrency.rs`.
//! The rules are target-agnostic — they consume only the
//! `launch_kind()` and `is_compute_bound()` declarations on each
//! Impl, both of which are uniform across architectures.
//!
//! ## First-cut rules (sm_89, L4)
//!
//! Encoded as four hand-written rules:
//!
//! 1. **CooperativeLaunch is exclusive.** Only one cooperative grid
//!    can be resident on the device. Two CooperativeLaunch impls
//!    scheduled at the same wave ⇒ infinite contention factor.
//!
//! 2. **Compute-bound impls don't overlap each other.** Two impls
//!    that are both `is_compute_bound() == true` and run on the
//!    same target's tensor cores get a contention factor of 1.0
//!    (no speedup from concurrency — they serialize on the
//!    saturated MMA pipeline).
//!
//! 3. **Memory-bound impls can overlap each other and a
//!    compute-bound impl.** A memory-bound op (norm, rope,
//!    silu_mul, residual_add) running concurrently with a
//!    compute-bound GEMM on a different stream actually overlaps
//!    on the target — the LSU and tensor cores are independent
//!    units. Contention factor for the memory-bound op is ~0.5
//!    (it runs roughly in the shadow of the compute-bound op).
//!
//! 4. **DeviceCallable inside a persistent megakernel** can
//!    overlap with other DeviceCallable impls in the same kernel
//!    if they're assigned to disjoint CTA subsets, modulo the
//!    resource-union constraint. The amortization factor is
//!    proportional to the CTA-subset coverage. Not yet exercised
//!    by the starter library (all HostCallback); returns 1.0 as a
//!    stub — extend when the first DeviceCallable+DeviceCallable
//!    case appears.
//!
//! These rules are minimal but enough to get the solver started.
//! Extension shape is documented inline.
