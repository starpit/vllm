//
// These preserve the shape of the previous hardcoded OpKind match
// in codegen.rs. The kernel symbols they reference are approximate
// and cuda-gated; real ferrite-kernels bindings land as calibrated
// impls replace these reference entries.

// No standalone `emit_rope_append`. The only ferrite-kernels path for
// "apply rotary + write KV to paged cache" is `fused_qkv_rope_cache`,
// which expects the QKV projections already fused into one packed
// tensor. `FusedQkvRopeCacheImpl` below claims the whole 4-tile
// pattern `(Gemm, Gemm, Gemm, RopeAppend)` structurally — so every
// DSL `rope_append` in Llama/Qwen2 is covered.

// No standalone `emit_attention`. Paged-cache attention
// (`flash_attn_paged`) takes Q plus cache metadata and reads K/V
// directly from the KV cache populated by `FusedQkvRopeCacheImpl`.
// `AttentionViaCacheImpl` below claims the singleton `OpKind::Attention`
// tile and ignores its DSL-visible K/V inputs entirely.

// No standalone `emit_add`: every `Add` in Llama/Qwen2 is immediately
// consumed by an `RmsNorm`, so `FusedAddRmsNormImpl` below claims
// the pair and maps to `fused_add_rms_norm_inplace`. A lone `Add`
// with no downstream `RmsNorm` surfaces as `SolveError::UnclaimedTile`,
// not as a silent fallback.

// pattern and mapping it to the `silu_and_mul_fused` kernel (which
// expects a packed `[num_tokens, 2*intermediate]` buffer).
//
// Match is purely structural — no phase tags, no weight-name
// checks. Pattern: two Gemm tiles sharing the same activation
// Tile-input feed a Silu and a Mul, with the Mul consuming the
// Silu output and the second Gemm output. Survives renaming
// gate_proj/up_proj → anything and survives adding new
// architectures that reuse the same topology.
//
// The impl declares one fused WeightBundle accessor (see
// `required_weights`) whose `rust_type` is `LinearLayer`. The user
// populates it with a `LinearLayer` carrying the vertically-
// concatenated `[gate_proj | up_proj]` weight; `LinearLayer::forward`
// on that produces the packed `gate_up` buffer `silu_and_mul_fused`
// wants. No intermediate D2D copies; no cross-impl contract.

// `Norm→Gemm` cuBLAS picks identified by `attack_surface.rs`'s
// fusion-gap analyzer. Three claim shapes:
//
//   1. (RmsNorm, Gemm)         — body norm whose only consumer is a
//                                 single Gemm. Most arches.
//   2. (LayerNorm, Gemm)       — Cohere-style. Same shape as (1) but
//                                 different norm kernel + weight type.
//   3. (Add, RmsNorm, Gemm)    — residual-stream norm followed by a
//                                 single-consumer Gemm. Lm_head's
//                                 canonical shape (`x = x + mlp; x_n =
//                                 norm(x); logits = lm_head(x_n)`).

//                                 in the DP's claim-size-DESC sort.
//
// All three are tile-zoo-pickable: one Impl per `CUTLASS_TILE_ZOO`
// entry. The runtime arm runs the existing norm kernel + the
// existing `cutlass::cutlass_gemm` — no new .cu file. The fusion is
// at the CLAIM level: by claiming the Gemm together with its upstream
// norm, the cost model can compare `(norm + cutlass_<tile>)` against
// `(norm-singleton + cuBLAS-Gemm)` at the bucket level rather than
// forcing the DP to evaluate them as independent steps.
//
// The DP picks naturally: claim-size-DESC means 3-tile fires before
// 2-tile, and within each, the lowest cost wins. multi-consumer norms
// (RmsNorm feeding Q+K+V — body residual stream) are rejected so
// FusedQkvRope* still claims them.

//
// Claims three tiles: a residual-stream Add (two Tile inputs), a
// scalar-offset Add (Weight + Scalar inputs), and a RmsNorm that
// consumes the residual-Add at slot 0 and the scalar-Add at slot 1.
// Emits a single `fused_add_rms_norm_inplace` call with the
// scalar as the kernel's `weight_offset` param.
//
// This is the Gemma2 mid-layer pattern:
//   hidden_states = add(delta, hidden_states);                 // residual
//   pre_ffwd     = rmsnorm(hidden_states, weight[i] + 1.0);    // norm
// and the cross-iteration pattern where the end-of-layer residual
// Add feeds the next iteration's pre-norm (or the final norm
// after the last iteration).
//
// Without this Impl, `FusedAddRmsNormImpl` absorbs the (Add,
// RmsNorm) pair, orphaning the scalar-offset Add with no other
// claim possible — the DP reports UnclaimedTile.

// tile zoo loses to cuBLAS (e.g. Qwen2-0.5B down_proj at prefill:
// M≈4096, N=896, K=4864).

// owns decode. Cost is a direct CSV lookup on
// `cutlass_WxH_sS_splitN`; rows missing for a shape fall back to
// `UNCALIBRATED_COST_US` so the DP ignores the variant there.
//
// Registered alongside `CutlassGemmImpl` in `starter_library`.

/// The pure-SplitK tile variants exported by
/// `vllm-cuda/csrc/cutlass_standalone_gemm.cu` and declared as

//
// Closes a structural anomaly the analyzer surfaces: the

// fusion shatters into `(Cublas-singleton, Add-singleton)` rather
// than landing as one fused-claim cuBLAS call. Only ~12 picks today
// (the analyzer's `Gemm→Add (CutlassGemmAdd peer; no cuBLAS peer)`
// row), but the structural completion matters for Step 5
// (FERRITE_DISABLE_CUBLAS_GEMM): without this Impl, those 12 picks
// would route through a `(GemmRefImpl, AddRefImpl)` pair, and
// `GemmRefImpl` is exactly the Impl Step 5 disables — leaving the
// pair claimable only by `CutlassGemmAdd` (which can already win
// these buckets via cost). With this Impl present, the env var
// gates BOTH the singleton AND the fused cuBLAS peer.
//
// Gated on the same `FERRITE_DISABLE_CUBLAS_GEMM` env var as
// `GemmRefImpl` so Step 5's A/B is symmetric — every cuBLAS-routing

// tp>1 the `insert_all_reduces` pass has already inserted an
// `AllReduce` between the Embed and its consumers, so this
// MmEmbedSplice ends up wired *after* the AllReduce — the mm_embeds
// D2D-overwrite thus runs on the fully-reduced embedding instead of
// on each rank's partial masked-gather (which would get summed × tp
// on the reduce). Lowers to `Instruction::SpliceMmEmbeds(slot)`.
//
// Identity-shape in-place mutation; output aliases the input slot
// (same pattern as AllReduce). Unconditionally inserted at every tp
// including tp=1 — at tp=1 it sits directly on the Embed output and
// reproduces the pre-refactor inline splice.
//

// ── AvgPool2dImpl (Phase G.7(b)) ─────────────────────────────────
//
// Singleton on `OpKind::AvgPool2d`. Claims any DSL call to
// `avg_pool_2d(x)` and emits one `Instruction::AvgPool2d { in_slot,
// out_slot }` row. The kernel reads `vision_patch_grid_side` and
// `vision_pool_kernel` off `CanonicalParams` to compute the output
// shape and walk the k² source cells per output row, so no per-call
// discriminant is needed on the opcode.
//
// Unlike the in-place GELU variants, this allocates a fresh smaller
// output buffer (`[L / k², e]`) — the output shape differs from the
// input shape, so we can't reuse the input's allocation. Same
// allocation pattern as `EmbeddingGather`. `consumes_input_tiles`
// stays empty: the source tile is reused / freed by the standard
// drop pass.
