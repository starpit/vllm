//! Canonical paged-KV-cache layout (Phase 5 of
//! `FERRITE_METAL_TYPE_SAFETY_PLAN.md`).
//!
//! Captures the single invariant
//!
//! ```text
//! KV cache buffer shape: [num_blocks, num_kv_heads, BLOCK_SIZE, head_dim]
//! ```
//!
//! and exposes one definition of the four strides that address into it:
//!
//! * `kv_blk_stride`   — elements between block_id and block_id + 1
//!   (= `num_kv_heads * BLOCK_SIZE * head_dim`)
//! * `kv_head_stride`  — elements between kv_head and kv_head + 1
//!   within one block (= `BLOCK_SIZE * head_dim`)
//! * `per_token_stride`— elements between slot_in_block S and S + 1
//!   (= `head_dim`)
//! * `buffer_elems`    — total elements per K (or V) buffer
//!   (= `num_blocks * kv_blk_stride`)
//!
//! Catches bug class #5 — the four-call-site stride-math drift the
//! plan calls out (`cpu_golden::rope_append_paged`,
//! `cpu_golden::attention_via_cache`, `cpu_golden::attention_prefill_paged`,
//! `interpreter::metal::pipelines` test harness).
//!
//! Lives at the crate root (not feature-gated) so both `cpu_golden`
//! (unconditional) and the metal-feature-gated callers can share one
//! definition. Args are bare `u32` to avoid pulling the metal-side
//! `ids` newtypes into CPU paths; metal call sites can wrap their
//! `PhysicalBlockIdx(_)` / `SlotInBlock(_)` payloads at the boundary.
