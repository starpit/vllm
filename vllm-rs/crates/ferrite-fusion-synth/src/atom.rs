// Backend-neutral atom abstraction for compiler-driven megakernel
// synthesis. See `METAL_KITTENS_SYNTHESIS_PLAN.md` at the worktree root
// for the architectural overview.
//
// An `Atom` is an `Implementation`'s view of itself as a composable
// primitive: it declares its dispatch shape, its I/O channels, and the
// per-backend code fragments that implement its body. The fuse pass
// (`fuse_pass.rs`, future) walks the solver's claim assignments,
// groups adjacent atoms whose dispatch shape and data flow are
// compatible, and emits one synthesized kernel per group by stitching
// the atom fragments together.
//
// Naming discipline: this module is backend-neutral on purpose. Atom
// kinds, signatures, channel types, and the trait surface do NOT
// reference Metal or CUDA. Only the per-backend `emit_*_body` methods
// produce backend-specific shader source. CUDA's `emit_cuda_body`
// lands in a later phase without touching this file.
