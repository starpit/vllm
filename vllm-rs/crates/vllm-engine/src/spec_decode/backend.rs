//! Backend primitive for spec decode.
//!
//! Spec decode (ngram, draft-model, EAGLE) needs exactly one GPU primitive
//! the rest of the architecture shouldn't know about: **forward + per-row
//! argmax** against a chosen model + KV pool. Everything else — verify
//! batch layout, rejection sampling, K-step chain orchestration, draft
//! KV mirroring, sync force, lookahead reservation — is structural and
//! lives in `vllm_engine::spec_decode` regardless of backend.
//!
//! The trait splits forward submission from completion:
//!
//!   * [`SpecDecodeBackend::submit_forward_argmax`] enqueues a forward +
//!     per-row-argmax pass against the given model + KV pool and returns
//!     an opaque handle.
//!   * [`SpecDecodeBackend::await_forward_argmax`] blocks the calling
//!     thread until the handle completes and returns the argmax row IDs.
//!
//! The split exists for phase 8 of the spec-decode refactor (overlap target
//! verify with draft chain via parallel command buffers / streams).
//! Callers that don't need overlap call [`SpecDecodeBackend::forward_argmax_blocking`]
//! — the default impl is `submit → await` back-to-back.
//!
//! Lifecycle methods ([`SpecDecodeBackend::load_secondary_model`],
//! [`SpecDecodeBackend::allocate_kv_pool`]) let the draft-model proposer
//! manage its second model + KV pool through the backend without leaking
//! `cudaMalloc` / `MTLBuffer` details.
